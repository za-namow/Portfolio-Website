                Hello there! My name is Tachawut Hirunburana, though I go by Namo. 
                I’m currently a student in M6 or grade 12 in Saint Gabriel’s college enrolled in Science 
                – Mathematics program or known in school as Engineering and Applied Science or EAS for short. 
                There’re many things to love and like in life but the one thing that I love the most is teamwork. 
                I love how we have to work in pair or team to accomplish something better and have many ideas embedded into a project/work. 
                If we’re talking about the topic that I love the most in computer engineering, that would be either IoT or Robotics. 
                I love the feeling of on-site working and getting my hand dirty but going slow and steady like website-development is also not bad in my humble opinion.
